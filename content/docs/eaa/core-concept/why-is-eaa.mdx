title: What is External Asset Assessment (EAA)?
description: This document provides an overview of External Asset Assessment (EAA), its significance in cybersecurity, and how the Fleetfolio EAA – Pentest Lite framework can assist penetration testers and security professionals in effectively assessing external assets.

External Asset Assessment (EAA)** involves the process of assessing and evaluating the external-facing assets of an organization. These assets are exposed to the internet and can include:

- Public-facing websites
- APIs
- DNS records
- Subdomains
- IP ranges

EAA is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in these publicly accessible assets that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to an organization's internal network or sensitive data.

### Key Aspects of EAA

In an EAA, the following key steps are involved:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering publicly available information such as domains, subdomains, and IP addresses.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identifying weaknesses in external-facing services such as web servers, APIs, and network configurations.
3. **Risk Identification**: Assessing the risk associated with each external asset by evaluating exposure to potential threats and vulnerabilities.

### Why Use the Fleetfolio EAA Framework?

The **Fleetfolio EAA – Pentest Lite** framework is designed to automate and streamline the process of conducting external asset assessments. By using a structured approach, it allows penetration testers to:

- Discover external assets such as domains, subdomains, and IP ranges.
- Resolve DNS configurations and identify associated IP ranges.
- Probe web services for potential vulnerabilities.
- Conduct vulnerability scans on live services.
- Extract metadata from web services for exploitation or mitigation strategies.

This framework is essential for organizations to understand their **attack surface** and identify potential weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.

### Why is EAA Important?

Understanding your external assets and their vulnerabilities is crucial in today's connected world. By performing regular **External Asset Assessments (EAA)**, organizations can:

- Identify exposed services that could be targeted by attackers.
- Prioritize remediation efforts based on identified vulnerabilities.
- Ensure compliance with security best practices and frameworks.
- Protect against data breaches, cyber-attacks, and unauthorized access.
