---


## **Overview**

The **Fleetfolio EAA – Pentest Lite** is a lightweight, authorized external asset assessment solution designed to perform various penetration testing tasks in a controlled environment. Built on **Kali Linux** (a popular penetration testing distribution), this tool provides an effective and structured workflow for security assessments, utilizing a chain of reconnaissance and validation tools.

This solution is designed to **scan external assets safely**, ensuring it operates within authorized and agreed-upon boundaries. All collected artifacts are stored in structured formats such as JSON, XML, and plain text for easy analysis and reporting.

## **Purpose**

Fleetfolio EAA – Pentest Lite aims to provide penetration testers with the tools and structure to perform lightweight external asset assessments in a secure and idempotent manner. The tools orchestrated by this framework include:

* **Domain discovery**
* **DNS resolution**
* **Web service probing**
* **Port scanning**
* **Technology fingerprinting**
* **TLS certificate checking**
* **Targeted vulnerability assessments**

The tools in this framework are scope-aware, meaning they respect exclusions and authorization from the target organization, ensuring compliance with the defined testing boundaries.

## **Components**

The framework comes equipped with several critical tools, which are essential for any penetration testing or security assessment. These tools help identify weaknesses in external assets, provide insights into security misconfigurations, and gather crucial metadata from domains, subdomains, IPs, and web services. Below is a quick overview of some of the components:

* **Reconnaissance Tools**: Includes `Subfinder`, `dnsx`, and `httpx-toolkit` for gathering subdomain data, resolving DNS, and probing HTTP services.
* **Fingerprinting**: Tools like `WhatWeb` help identify technologies and vulnerabilities in web applications.
* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Includes powerful tools like `Nuclei` for template-based vulnerability scanning, and `Nikto` for identifying potential security flaws in web servers.
* **Port Scanning**: `Naabu` and `RustScan` provide high-performance port scanning for identifying exposed services.
* **Web Application Testing**: Tools such as `SQLmap`, `Commix`, and `WAF-Bypass` automate the testing of common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, and bypassing web application firewalls.

All findings are saved in structured formats like **JSON**, **XML**, and **CSV**, making it easy for analysts to review and generate reports.

## **Getting Started**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the Fleetfolio EAA – Pentest Lite workflow, from **manual installation** of Kali Linux and required dependencies, to the automated scanning and vulnerability assessments.

It includes:

1. **Installation Instructions**: A comprehensive guide on how to set up the environment, including VirtualBox and Kali Linux, along with prerequisite dependencies like **Homebrew** and **Go**.
2. **Tool Setup**: Instructions on how to install and configure penetration testing tools like `Subfinder`, `Nmap`, `Nikto`, `SQLmap`, and more.
3. **Runbook Execution**: Detailed steps to initiate and run the Fleetfolio EAA workflow, whether manually or through Docker, ensuring a streamlined testing process.
4. **Error Handling**: Solutions for common errors and troubleshooting tips to ensure smooth execution during the assessment.

## **Use Cases**

The Fleetfolio EAA – Pentest Lite framework can be used in a variety of scenarios, including:

* **Authorized Penetration Testing**: Use this framework for internal and external asset assessments with full client consent.
* **Bug Bounty Programs**: Automate the reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery phase of bug bounty submissions.
* **Security Audits**: Help identify misconfigurations, outdated systems, and security gaps in web applications, networks, and cloud assets.
* **Red Team Engagements**: Use as a primary tool for mapping and assessing external attack surfaces during red team exercises.

By following this guide and leveraging the tools provided, penetration testers and security analysts can effectively assess external assets for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other security weaknesses, all while maintaining an organized and compliant testing process.
