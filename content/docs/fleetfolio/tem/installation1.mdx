# Prerequisite Dependency

Follow these instructions carefully to ensure all dependencies are correctly configured for your system.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && echo >> /home/kali/.zshrc && echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/kali/.zshrc && eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)" && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential && brew install gcc
```

<Callout type="info">
**Note :** Run this command inside a non-root user terminal. You will be prompted to enter the password, and then press Enter again to continue
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

## Install [Surveilr](https://www.surveilr.com/)

Get the latest Resource Surveillance & Integration Engine (surveilr) for Critical Systems by following these steps to complete the installation:

```bash 
wget https://github.com/surveilr/packages/releases/download/3.19.0/surveilr_3.19.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz && \
tar -xvf surveilr_3.19.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz && \
mv surveilr /usr/local/bin
```

- Please try to download the latest version. You can find latest releases [here](https://github.com/opsfolio/releases.opsfolio.com/releases)

</Step>

<Step>

### Homebrew-installed tools not accessible when switching to root user (Solution: Add Homebrew to root’s shell environment)

```bash 
sudo su && echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /root/.zshrc && eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

- Paste it again after switching to the root user.

</Step>

<Step>

## Install [Spry](https://sprymd.org/)

- Before installing spry, make sure that you have installed deno.

```bash 
brew install programmablemd/packages/spry
```

<Callout type="warn">
Make sure you have installed `brew` using the steps above and that it is also available for the `root user`, as mentioned earlier.
</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>
```

### Why this is accurate:
1.  **Exact Commands:** Every `&&` and `echo` in your Homebrew script and the extraction flags in your Surveilr script have been kept as is.
2.  **No Text Skipping:** Your specific instructions regarding non-root users, passwords, and pasting commands again for the root user are included.
3.  **Strict Markdown:** I ensured that the `Step` tags wrap around your existing headers and bullet points without deleting them.
4.  **Syntax Error Protection:** Blank lines are added around the code blocks and Callouts to ensure it passes the MDX parser without "mismatch" errors.
