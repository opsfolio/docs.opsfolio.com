How to submit changes to Spry.

## Before You Start

<Callout type="info">
Planning ahead saves time and increases the chance of your PR being accepted.
</Callout>

1. **Check existing issues** - Your idea may already be discussed
2. **Open an issue first** - For significant changes, discuss before coding
3. **Understand the codebase** - Read relevant documentation
