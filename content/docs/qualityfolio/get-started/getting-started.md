title: Quick Start Guide
description: This document outlines the step-by-step setup of Qualityfolio, a Test-Management-as-Code (TMaC) system powered by Spry’s Axiom-based execution pattern and Surveilr’s ingestion, transformation, and ETL pipeline.
---

This guide helps you quickly set up Qualityfolio, generate a queryable SQLite database from test artifacts, and launch a Test Management Dashboard using Spry, Surveilr, and SQLPage.

Welcome to Qualityfolio - a Markdown-native Test Management system backed by Spry’s ontology engine and Surveilr’s data ingestion pipeline. Qualityfolio follows a Test Management as Code (TMaC) approach, where test artifacts, execution evidence, and dashboards are all derived from structured files under version control.

---

## Objectives

Qualityfolio is designed to:

1. Generate an SQLite database from test artifact and execution evidence files.
2. Generate a Test Management Dashboard for test metrics, traceability, and execution insights.
3. HTML UI Generation (Live Preview) with real-time ontology parsing, live reload, and structural validation.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools and files are available on your system before proceeding:

1. Deno – runtime required by Spry
2. Homebrew (brew) – package manager for installing dependencies
3. Surveilr – ingestion and transformation engine
4. Spry – runbook and SQLPage orchestration engine
5. SQLPage – UI layer for the Test Management Dashboard. Already built-in with Surveilr
6. qualityfolio-json-etl.sql – SQL-based ETL script for Qualityfolio data
7. qualityfolio.md – Markdown file containing database configuration and SQLPage queries
8. sqlpage.json – SQLPage runtime configuration file (under `./sqlpage/`)

---

## Installation

To work with Spry and the Surveilr-based Qualityfolio framework, you need to install Deno, Homebrew, Spry, and Surveilr, and ensure the required Qualityfolio files are available in your workspace.

---

### Installation Steps

Open your terminal and switch to your workspace directory:

```bash
cd $HOME/workspaces
```

---

#### 1. Install Homebrew (if not already installed)

Homebrew is required to install Spry.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Verify Homebrew installation:

```bash
brew --version
```

---

#### 2. Install Deno

Install Deno using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.com/install.sh | sh
```

Verify your Deno installation:

```bash
deno --version
```

Upgrade Deno to the latest version:

```bash
deno upgrade
```

---

#### 3. Install Spry

If you are a first-time Spry user:

```bash
brew install programmablemd/packages/spry
```

Upgrade Spry, if Spry is already installed:

```bash
brew uninstall spry
brew untap programmablemd/packages
brew install programmablemd/packages/spry
```

Verify your Spry installation:

```bash
spry --version
```

For more details on Spry installation and usage, refer to the [official Spry documentation](https://docs.opsfolio.com/spry/getting-started/installation).

---

#### 4. Install Surveilr

Check if Surveilr already exists on your system:

```bash
which surveilr
```

If an existing version is found, remove it:

```bash
sudo rm -rf <surveilr_path_with_file_name>
```

Download Surveilr version 3.10.0 or above (the following example uses version 3.19.0):

```bash
wget https://github.com/surveilr/packages/releases/download/3.19.0/surveilr_3.19.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

Extract the archive:

```bash
tar -xzf surveilr_3.19.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

Move Surveilr to `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
sudo mv surveilr /usr/local/bin/
```

Verify Surveilr installation and ensure the version is v3.10.0 or above:

```bash
surveilr --version
sudo surveilr upgrade -v 3.19.0
```

For more details on Surveilr installation and usage, refer to the [official Surveilr documentation](https://docs.opsfolio.com/surveilr/core/installation).

## Folder Structure

Qualityfolio expects the following directory structure:

```text
ASSURANCE-PRIME/
├── support/
│   └── assurance/
│       └── qualityfolio/
│           ├── evidence/
│           │   ├── TC-GLUE-001/
│           │   │   └── 1.1/

│           ├── sqlpage/
│           │   └── sqlpage.json                  # runtime configuration file for SQLPage, auto-generated
│           ├── test-artifacts/
│           │   └── example-artifact.md
│           ├── qualityfolio-json-etl.sql         # SQL ETL script for Qualityfolio data
│           ├── qualityfolio.md                   # SQLPage Markdown page (DB config + queries)
│           └── resource-surveillance.sqlite.db   # Database generated
```

### Key Directories and Files

- test-artifacts/ – Authoring location for test cases, plans, suites, and metadata
- evidence/ – Location for test execution evidence (results, runs, attachments)
- qualityfolio.md – Core logic file that defines database creation and SQLPage queries
- qualityfolio-json-etl.sql – ETL script that transforms ingested JSON into relational tables
- sqlpage/sqlpage.json – SQLPage runtime configuration
- resource-surveillance.sqlite.db – Generated SQLite database containing test data

---

## Authoring Tests in Markdown

Qualityfolio tests follow a structured Markdown hierarchy to ensure full traceability and machine-readable execution. Qualityfolio projects can range from simple to highly complex structures. You can explore ready-made examples based on real-world implementations.

An example test artifact file (example-artifact.md) for the project, OWASP - GLUE UP (with Qualityfolio's Small pattern) is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programmablemd/assurance-prime/refs/heads/main/support/assurance/qualityfolio/test-artifacts/example-artifact.md).

This example demonstrates:

* Header-based classification
* Hierarchical test design
* Evidence block patterns

---

## Step 1: Generate SQLite Database from Test Artifacts

To generate a queryable SQLite database from your test artifacts and execution evidence, run the following command from the `qualityfolio` directory:

```bash
spry rb run qualityfolio.md
```

### What This Does

- Parses test artifacts under `test-artifacts/`
- Ingests execution evidence under `evidence/`
- Applies the ETL logic defined in `qualityfolio.md` and `qualityfolio-json-etl.sql`
- Produces a clean, ready-to-use SQLite database: `resource-surveillance.sqlite.db`

You can open this database using any SQLite-compatible SQL editor for ad-hoc analysis or reporting.

---

## Step 2: Generate Test Management Dashboard

The Test Management Dashboard provides a live, browser-based view of Qualityfolio metrics.

### 2.1 Prepare Test Artifacts

Ensure your test cases and related metadata are authored as Markdown files under: `test-artifacts/`

---

### 2.2 Run Spry + SQLPage Pipeline

Execute the following commands in a terminal from the `qualityfolio` directory:

```bash
spry rb run qualityfolio.md
spry sp spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json --md qualityfolio.md
spry sp spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json --md qualityfolio.md --watch
```

This pipeline:

- Rebuilds the database from artifacts and evidence
- Generates `sqlpage.json` in the `sqlpage` folder and configures SQLPage using `sqlpage.json`
- Loads SQLPage queries defined in `qualityfolio.md`
- Watches for file changes and auto-refreshes the data

---

### 2.3 Start SQLPage Server

In a separate terminal, from the `qualityfolio` directory, start the SQLPage server:

```bash
sqlpage
```

---

### 2.4 Access the Test Management Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:9227/`

The dashboard includes:

- Test metrics and summaries
- Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- Test cycle-wise execution status
- Case-level execution details with linked evidence

---

## Step 3: HTML UI Generation (Live Preview)

You can launch the server using the following command in a terminal from the `qualityfolio` directory:

```bash
spry axiom web-ui test-artifacts/example-artifact.md
```

Running this command loads the parsed test artifact(s) in your browser with:

* Real-time ontology parsing
* Automatic live reload whenever you save a file
* A structured HTML UI showing headings, roles, metadata, hierarchy, cases, and evidence
* Built-in validation of classification rules and document structure

This feature allows you to visually inspect and validate your Qualityfolio pattern directly from HTML UI.

---

## Next Steps

Once your database and dashboard are running, you can:

- Query `resource-surveillance.sqlite.db` for custom analytics
- Extend SQLPage views by updating `qualityfolio.md`
- Add new test artifacts and execution evidence
- Integrate Qualityfolio into CI/CD pipelines
