---

Qualityfolio is a modern Test Management as Code (TMaC) and evidence-driven assurance framework built to bring structure, transparency, and governance to the entire testing and compliance lifecycle. It aligns quality engineering, security validation, site reliability practices, and compliance requirements into a single, repeatable operating model.

Unlike traditional test management tools, Qualityfolio treats tests, execution steps, and evidence as version-controlled assets, enabling true auditability and continuous improvement.

## What is Qualityfolio?

Qualityfolio is a unified framework that helps organizations design, execute, and govern their quality processes with a strong focus on evidence and traceability. It connects the work of:

* Quality Assurance (QA)
* Security Engineering
* Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
* DevOps and Platform teams
* Compliance and Audit functions

Key capabilities include:

* Markdown-first test design – Write human-readable, developer-friendly test cases in simple Markdown that live alongside your code.
* Runbook-based execution – Standardize execution using structured operational runbooks for repeatability and consistency.
* SQL-backed evidence storage – Store test results, artifacts, logs, and proof in a structured, queryable evidence store.
* Git-native versioning and auditability – Track every change through Git, enabling full change history and audit trails.

Qualityfolio is fully integrated with Surveilr, enabling:

* Real-time dashboards and test health visibility
* Compliance and control coverage analytics
* Continuous audit readiness with live evidence

## Who Uses Qualityfolio

Qualityfolio is designed for cross-functional teams, including:

* QA & Test Engineers – To design structured test strategies and manage execution at scale.
* SRE & DevOps Teams – To validate system reliability, resilience, and operational readiness.
* Security Engineers – To manage security test cases, threat validations, and control verification.
* Audit & Compliance Teams – To access real-time evidence and traceability for regulatory requirements.
* Product and Quality Leaders – To gain visibility into quality posture, risk exposure, and delivery readiness.

## Core Benefits

Organizations using Qualityfolio gain significant operational and governance advantages:

* End-to-end traceability – Every requirement, test, execution, and evidence artifact is linked and traceable.
* Code-reviewable test artifacts – Tests live as code, enabling peer review, approvals, and collaboration.
* Unified manual and automated testing – A single framework to manage both human-driven and automated validations.
* Structured evidence model – A standardized, queryable approach to storing logs, screenshots, system outputs, and proofs.
* Continuous governance and compliance – Always-on control validation with continuous policy and regulatory alignment.

## How Qualityfolio Works

1. Define tests in Markdown aligned to requirements and controls.
2. Execute tests using standardized operational runbooks.
3. Capture structured evidence automatically during execution.
4. Store all results in SQL-backed evidence repositories.
5. Version and audit all changes through Git.
6. Visualize quality and compliance posture using Surveilr dashboards.

## Getting Started

Start by installing Qualityfolio, connecting your source repository, and creating your first Markdown-based test case. Follow the setup guides to begin building continuous, evidence-driven quality across your organization.
