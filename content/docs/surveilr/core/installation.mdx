## Verify Installation

Run the following commands to verify that `surveilr` is installed correctly:

```bash
$ surveilr --version                      # version information
$ surveilr doctor                         # dependencies that surveilr uses
$ surveilr --help                         # get CLI help (pay special attention to ENV var names)
```

<Callout>
  Check out more commands in the [CLI reference](/docs/core/cli/cli-commands).
</Callout>

## Upgrading `surveilr`

To upgrade `surveilr` to the latest version or a specific version:

```bash
$ surveilr upgrade                        # upgrades to the latest version

$ surveilr upgrade -v 0.13.0              # upgrades to version 0.13.0 if present
```

When using the command above, you will be prompted to confirm the upgrade by typing `yes`. However, if you are running the upgrade in a bash script, you won't be able to provide this confirmation interactively.

Use the `--yes` or `--y` flag to automatically skip the confirmation step:

```bash
$ surveilr upgrade --yes                  # upgrades to the latest version and skips confirmation

$ surveilr upgrade -v 0.13.0 --yes        # upgrades to version 0.13.0 and skips confirmation
```

## Downgrading `surveilr`

To downgrade `surveilr` to any specific version:

```bash
$ surveilr upgrade -v 0.12.0              # downgrades to version 0.12.0
```

<Callout type="info">
  The downgrade command uses the same format as the upgrade command with the only difference being that a lower version number is passed.
