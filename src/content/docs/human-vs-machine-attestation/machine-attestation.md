### Evolution of Technology in Compliance Attestation
Over the past few decades, the advancement of technology has transformed compliance processes. Initially, compliance relied heavily on manual processes and human judgment. However, with the advent of sophisticated software and tools, many aspects of compliance have been automated, leading to increased efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

## Types of Machine Attestation

### Automated Logging
- **Continuous Logging Systems**: Automated logging systems continuously capture and store system activities. These logs are crucial for tracking user actions, detecting anomalies, and ensuring compliance with security policies.
- **Importance and Benefits of Tamper-Proof Logs**: Tamper-proof logs ensure the integrity and reliability of logged data, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to alter or delete logs.

```

### Monitoring Tools
- **Real-Time Monitoring Systems**: These systems continuously monitor network traffic, system activities, and user actions in real time. They provide immediate visibility into potential compliance issues.
- **Role of Automated Alerts and Responses**: Automated monitoring tools generate alerts when potential compliance violations are detected, allowing for immediate investigation and response.
