### Requirements
All you need is a Linux server with these tools installed:

- docker
- docker-compose
- curl

### Self-host using SFTP:

Clone the repository.

```   bash
git clone https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash.git
```

Navigate to the Folder.  

``` bash
cd filestash/docker
```

Modify the docker-compose file as below:

```  bash

version: '2'
services:
  app:
    container_name: filestash
    image: machines/filestash
    restart: always
    environment:
    - APPLICATION_URL=
    - GDRIVE_CLIENT_ID=<gdrive_client>
    - GDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=<gdrive_secret>
    - DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID=<dropbox_key>
    - ONLYOFFICE_URL=http://onlyoffice
    ports:
    - "8334:8334"
    volumes:
    - filestash:/app/data/state/

  onlyoffice:
    container_name: filestash_oods
    image: onlyoffice/documentserver
    restart: always
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
  sftp:
   container_name: sftp-opsfolio
   image: atmoz/sftp
   restart: always
   volumes:
     - sftp_data:/home
   command: >
     <username>:<passwd>:::<folder-name>/
     observe:pass:::log/

volumes:
    filestash: {}
    sftp_data: {}
```


To start the application with Docker Compose, use the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Set up a reverse proxy to create a custom URL, such as `https://files.opsfolio.com/`, and then proceed to configure your admin password.

You can set the administrator password in this section.

Next, choose `SFTP` as your `Storage Backend` .

Use the credentials you specified in the docker-compose file to log in as an SFTP user.

Enter the hostname, which should match the `sftp` container name, in this example, `sftp-opsfolio` (sftp container name accessed internally) 

Navigate to `advanced` settings and specify port `22`.

Once you have clicked `CONNECT`, you will be directed to the default directory set in your docker-compose file.

From here, you can create `NEW FILE` or `NEW FOLDER` by clicking on new file or new folder. To manage permissions, hover over the file or folder, and click the 'share' icon to set the  `Authorization component`.

- Authorization component: Define the permissions for each user once they have logged in. You can assign different access levels such as `viewer, editor, or uploader`. For instance, you may want to grant read/write access to the marketing department, while limiting the sales department to read-only access.

Once youâ€™ve set the appropriate permissions and restrictions, you can copy and share the link with users as needed.
