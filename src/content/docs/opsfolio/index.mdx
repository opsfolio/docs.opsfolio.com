<Card title="We envision a world where engineers and other individual contributors deliver reliable and secure regulated products without worrying about compliance." />

<Card title="Our mission is to provide content and tools to ICs that shows them how to do the Right Thing&trade; and generate compliance artifacts as a byproduct of their real work.">
  Opsfolio will reshape the safety and security compliance landscape for
  engineering and product teams by letting individual contributors (ICs) focus
  on _creating_. Opsfolio delivers a [Quality Management System
  (QMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management_system): - Opinionated
  but configurable policy _content_ that defines rules. - Suite of _software_
  which uses machine attestation to verify IC adherence to policies and rules.

  <Card title="Compliance as Code">
    We're here for software engineering and product development teams. We want
    to treat compliance like any other aspect of software development â€”-
    something that can and should be automated, tested and improved upon
    continuously. By [codifying compliance practices and policies](https://shahidshah.com/2023/09/30/compliance-as-code), teams can
    establish guardrails that actually work seamlessly with their workflows
    instead of against them.

  <Card title="Evidence-driven" icon="star">
    While traditional compliance often relies on _human attestation_, we
    champion a shift to _machine attestation_. For us, it's about replacing the
    age-old "trust us" with data-driven, machine-generated evidence.

    Opsfolio maximizes compliant security and [eliminates **_compliant insecurity_**](https://compliant-insecurity.com).
