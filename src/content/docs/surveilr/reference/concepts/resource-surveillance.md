**`Resource Surveillance State Database`**  is a SQLite database generated by the Surveilr tool, which can be used independently to provide machine-attested evidence of compliance and security across various work products and disciplines within an organization. This helps overcome the limitations of human-based compliance verification processes.

## Characteristics of a RSSD

- **Independence**: Once the RSSD is generated, it is no longer tied to `surveilr` and can be used by any other tool, service, application, or ETL'd into a data warehouse which makes it a versatile data source.

- **Consumption**: It can be consumed by any computing environment that supports `SQLite` 
, allowing it to be integrated into various systems and workflows

- **Evidence Collection**: It is designed to collect machine attestation artifacts like code, test results, emails, issues/tickets, and wikis to prove that security, privacy, safety and regulatory compliance policies are being followed. This provides a more reliable and automated way to demonstrate compliance compared to relying on human attestation.
