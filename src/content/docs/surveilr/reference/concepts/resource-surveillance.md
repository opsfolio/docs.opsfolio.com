**`Resource Surveillance State Database`**  is a SQLite database generated by the Surveilr tool, which can be used independently to provide machine-attested evidence of compliance and security across various work products and disciplines within an organization. This helps overcome the limitations of human-based compliance verification processes.

## Characteristics of a RSSD

- **Independence**: Once the RSSD is generated, it is no longer tied to `surveilr` and can be used by any other tool, service, application, or ETL'd into a data warehouse which makes it a versatile data source.

- **Consumption**: It can be consumed by any computing environment that supports `SQLite` 
, allowing it to be integrated into various systems and workflows

- **Evidence Collection**: It is designed to collect machine attestation artifacts like code, test results, emails, issues/tickets, and wikis to prove that security, privacy, safety and regulatory compliance policies are being followed. This provides a more reliable and automated way to demonstrate compliance compared to relying on human attestation.

## How to generate an RSSD

Generating a `RSSD` requires you to execute a `survielr ingest` command which can either be [file ingestion](/surveilr/reference/ingest/files#ingest-files) or [task ingestion](/surveilr/reference/ingest/files). Suppose you have folder  named `my-files` and it is located within your current working directory, you can ingest the files in this folder by navigating into the folder ( `cd` ), and  executing this script:

```bash
$ surveilr ingest files 
```
An `RSSD` will be created inside `my-files`

if you prefer not `cd` into `my-files` before performing file ingestion, there is a `-r` flag that allows you to specify `my-files` as the folder you wish to ingest its content(s) without having to leave your root directory.

```bash
$ surveilr ingest files -r <PATH>/my-files
```

The outcome of the execution of this script above is a `resource-surveillance.sqlite.db` file ( known as `resource surveillance state database - RSSD` ) created in your root directory. 

The database consist of several tables which can you can learn about [here](/surveilr/reference/db/surveilr-state-schema/state-schema#tables).
