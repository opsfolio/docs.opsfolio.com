## Upgrading `surveilr`

The following commands shows how to upgrade `surveilr` on your:

```bash
$ surveilr upgrade ## Upgrades to the latest version

$ surveilr upgrade -v 0.1.2 ## Upgrades to version 0.1.2 if present
```

When using the command above, you will be prompted to confirm the upgrade by typing `yes`. However, if you are running the upgrade in a bash script, you won't be able to provide this confirmation interactively. To address this, we have provided the `--yes` or `--y` flag, which automatically skips the confirmation step. Here is how to use it:

```bash
## Upgrades to the latest version and skips confirmation
$ surveilr upgrade --yes

## Upgrades to version 0.1.2 if present and  skips the confirmation
$ surveilr upgrade -v 0.1.2 --yes
```

## Shell Completions
```bash
$ surveilr --completions fish | source    # setup shell completions to reduce typing
``` -->
