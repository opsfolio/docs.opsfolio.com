Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.13.0

## What's New
### 1. Upgraded SQLPage
- The SQLPage dependency has been upgraded to version `0.27.0` to ensure improved stability and performance.

### 2. Enhanced Orchestration Session Listing
- The `surveilr orchestrate sessions` command now produces a comprehensive list of orchestration sessions, regardless of their nature.

### 3. Filtered Orchestration Session Listing
- The `surveilr orchestrate sessions -n "v&v"/"csv"` command now allows users to filter and produce a list of orchestration sessions specific to a given nature.

### 4. New Command: `surveilr doctor`
- Added the `surveilr doctor` command, which displays the versions of `sqlite3`, `deno`, and `rust` (if installed) on the host machine.

### 5. Version Tracking in Orchestration
- When an orchestration is executed, the current versions of `sqlpage`, `rusqlite`, `pgwire`, and `udi_pgp` used by the current `surveilr` binary are now added to the `version` column in the `orchestration_session` table and the `device elaboration` field.
