Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.13.6

## Bug Fixes

#### 1. **Fix file content duplication during file ingestion**

**Issue:**  
We were facing file content duplication during the `surveilr ingest files` operation inside the `uniform_resource` table. This occurred when there were changes to file properties such as inode, even if the content inside the file remained the same.

**Fix:**  
The bug was resolved by removing the `last_modified` field from the unique index on the `uniform_resource` model. This prevents duplication when ingesting files with unchanged content.

#### 2. **Ensure idempotency during CSV auto-transformation ingestion**

**Issue:**  
When running the command `surveilr ingest files --csv-transform-auto`, tables are created based on the file names inside the folder (e.g., `code_quality_infrastructure.csv` creates a table `uniform_resource_code_quality_infrastructure`). The issue arose when the command was run multiple timesâ€”it inserted the same data repeatedly, leading to duplication.

**Fix:**  
The issue was fixed by dropping the CSV table first and then recreating it only if there are no changes to the resource. This ensures the command is idempotent and prevents duplicate entries on repeated runs.
