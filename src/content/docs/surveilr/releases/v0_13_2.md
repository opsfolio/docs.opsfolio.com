Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.13.2

## What's New

### `surveilr admin merge` Enhancements

- **New Argument: `-table-name-patterns` or `-p`**
  - Introduced a new argument `-table-name-patterns` (or shorthand `-p`) to the `surveilr admin merge` command.
  - This argument allows users to specify a list of regular expressions to include specific table names in the merge process.
  - Example usage:
    ```bash
    surveilr admin merge -p "audit_session%" -p "activity_log%"
    ```
## Bug Fixes
