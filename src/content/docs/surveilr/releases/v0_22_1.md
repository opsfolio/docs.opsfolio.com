Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.22.1
This release introduces new output formatting options for the `surveilr shell` command, enabling users to tailor how SQL query results are displayed. With the ability to choose between JSON, table, and line formats, these enhancements build on the goal of making `surveilr` a lightweight and unopinionated alternative to `sqlite3` or `duckdb`, providing users with a simple yet powerful way to execute SQL scripts.

By default, the output format is set to JSON, and the results will only be printed for Data Query Language (DQL) statements. If a query is non-DQL (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE), no output will be displayed.

## What's New
---

### 1. Output Formatting for SQL Queries

- **`--output json`** (Default): 
  - Takes the output of the last SQL statement and returns it in JSON format.
  - This is useful when you need to process the output programmatically or need a structured format.
  - If no `--output` option is specified, results will be printed in JSON by default, as long as the query is a DQL query (e.g., `SELECT`).
  - Non-DQL queries (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`) will not print any output.

  Example usage:
  ```bash
  surveilr shell --output json "SELECT * FROM users"
