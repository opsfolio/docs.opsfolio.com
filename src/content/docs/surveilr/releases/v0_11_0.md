Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.11.0

## What's New
1. **Host Binding Customization:**
    - The `web-ui` server now accepts a `--host` argument to specify the host to which it should be bound, providing more flexibility in deployment.
    - By default, the server binds to localhost instead of 127.0.0.1.

2. **Server Start Message:**
    - Updated the server start message to read: "RSSD Web UI is now running on ...", enhancing clarity for users monitoring server status.

3. **SQLPage**
    - Updated SQLPage to the latest version, ensuring compatibility and access to the newest features and bug fixes.

## Bug Fixes
1. **Ctrl+C Shutdown Error**:
     - Resolved the error encountered when stopping the web UI with Ctrl+C, which previously resulted in Error: No such file or directory (os error 2).
   
2. **SQLPage Directory Creation:**
    - Disabled the SQLPage feature that was creating an empty sqlpage directory with each execution, preventing unnecessary directory creation.

3. **Multitenant Support**
     - Fixed the error during ingestion related to multitenant support by seeding the `party_types` back into the models directly.
