Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.23.0

## What's New
---

- **Environment Variable Import with Regular Expressions:**
  Added the `--import-env "<regex>"` option to `surveilr shell`. This feature allows users to import environment variables that match a given regular expression into the `session_state_ephemeral` table, making them available for scripts. Users must explicitly provide the regular expression they wish to use, (`.*` must be specified manually if desired).

- **Argument Parsing and Upsert:**
  Enhanced the argument parsing capability of `surveilr shell` to handle any arguments passed with the `--arg` prefix (e.g., `--arg1 abc`, `--arg2 xyz`). These arguments are automatically upserted into the `session_state_ephemeral` table, allowing them to be referenced within the session.

- **Custom Session State Table:**
  Introduced the `--session-state-table-name` argument, allowing users to specify a custom name for the session state table. By default, the table is named `session_state_ephemeral`, but this can now be overridden as needed.

- **Idempotent Session State Table Creation:**
  Ensured that the session state table (whether default or custom) is created in a safe, idempotent manner. A TEMP table with the name `session_state_ephemeral` (or the specified table name) is created using the schema: `CREATE TABLE "session_state_ephemeral" (KEY, VALUE)`.
