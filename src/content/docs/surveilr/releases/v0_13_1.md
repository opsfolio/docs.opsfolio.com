Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.13.1

### What's New

1. **Notebook Orchestration**
   - Introduced a powerful new feature that allows executing scripts stored within `code_notebook_cell`, similar to stored procedures. 
   - You can use the `--notebook` (`-n`) and `--cell` (`-c`) arguments to select multiple notebooks and cells, orchestrating them in a single session.
   - The `-arg` flag now creates a temporary table `surveilr_orchestration_session_arg` with columns `session_id`, `key`, and `value`. All provided arguments are inserted as rows in this table, allowing the `code_notebook_cell` SQL code to leverage these inputs dynamically.

### Bug Fixes

- **Cargo-Metadata Command Failure**
  - Resolved an issue where all commands were failing due to `cargo-metadata`. This fix ensures stability and seamless execution of commands moving forward.
- **`surveilr doctor` fixes** 
   -  `surveilr doctor` only makes SQLite compulsory, all other dependencies are not required
