Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.13.3

## Bug Fixes

### Orchestration Scripts
- The execution and handling of orchestration scripts have been modified. Rather than running them as a batch, they now utilize prepared statements.

### `admin merge` Command
- The `--sql-only` flag is designed to output the SQL for the merge directly to the console. This functionality was not operational in previous versions, but has been corrected and is now functional.
