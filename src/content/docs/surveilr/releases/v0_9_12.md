Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.9.12

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the default `--status` argument was set to unread instead of read. Emails can now be properly filtered based on the specified status.

## What's New

- **Reduce Data Duplication Flag:** Introduced a new flag `--reduce-data-duplication` for data transformation commands. This can be executed as such: `surveilr transform --reduce-data-duplication csv`. When this flag is set:
  - The content table in uniform_resource is nulled out for entries transformed into tables.
  - This change is recorded in the elaboration field.
- **Tracking Transformations:** Transformations of CSV or other file types are now tracked within the tables. This provides a clear audit trail of what transformations have been applied in the `elaboration` field of the transformed columns.
