Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.21.0

We are excited to announce the release of new features in `surveilr`, specifically focusing on the `shell` command. This release brings a lightweight, unopinionated alternative to `sqlite3` or `duckdb`, allowing users to execute SQL scripts easily, while offering minimal logging compared to the highly opinionated `orchestrate` command.

The `shell` and `orchestrate` commands are now closely related, with `shell` providing a simpler execution flow without detailed tracking. In contrast, `orchestrate` offers robust logging and support functions. 

## New Features

### 1. Default Engine
- **`surveilr shell --engine rusqlite`**: Rusqlite is the default engine for the `shell` command unless the `--engine` option is overridden.

### 2. Multi-Script Execution
- **`surveilr shell first.sql second.sql https://site.com/third.sql`**: 
  - Supports executing multiple SQL scripts passed as arguments, whether from local or remote locations.
  - **Globs**: You can now use globs such as `**/*.sql` and `**/*.sql.ts` to match and execute files in sorted depth-first order.
  - **File Type Handling**: 
    - Files ending in `.sql` are treated as direct SQL files.
    - Files ending in other extensions (like `.sql.ts`) are treated as potentially runnable files:
      - **Local Executable**: If the file is local and executable, it will be run, and the STDOUT output will be used for SQL execution.
      - **Remote Executable**: For security reasons, remote executable files cannot be run and will produce an error message: `remote files cannot be executed due to safety reasons`.

### 3. Command-Line SQL Execution
- **`surveilr shell --cmd "select * from table"`**: Now supports executing SQL commands passed directly through the command line, similar to `sqlite3`'s `-cmd` option.

### 4. STDIN Support
- **`cat my.sql | surveilr shell`** and **`surveilr shell < my.sql`**: `surveilr` now supports executing SQL scripts via STDIN, allowing seamless integration with piping or file redirection.

### 5. Observability and Logging
- **Logging Execution**: Unless the `--no-observability` flag is used, `surveilr shell` will log the execution into the orchestration tables:
  - **`orchestration_nature`**: Logs the nature of the execution as `shell-<engine>` (e.g., `shell-rusqlite`).
  - **`orchestration_session`**: Logs a new session for each execution.
  - **`orchestration_session_log`**: Logs any exceptions or errors that occur during the execution for better debugging and traceability.
