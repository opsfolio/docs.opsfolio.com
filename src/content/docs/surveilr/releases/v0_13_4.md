Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.13.4

## Bug Fixes

### Orchestration Scripts Execution
- The execution and management of orchestration scripts have been restored to their initial configuration. They are now being executed in batches. Please note that only DML queries will be processed. More complex scripts should be automated using Deno. Additionally, support for executing Deno scripts with `surveilr` will be introduced in the upcoming release.

## Assets
