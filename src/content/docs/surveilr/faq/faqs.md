<summary class="faq">
<h6>Why should I use Surveilr?</h6>
</summary>

<p>Surveilr is the better option for gathering compliance proof through machine
attestation, which is why you should use it. Code, test results, emails,
issues/tickets, and wikis are examples of machine attestation artifacts that
Surveilr's agent can use to conclusively demonstrate adherence to security,
privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance policiesâ€”as opposed to human
attestation, which depends on trust and manual processes. Through the use of
this method, people can verify information more quickly and accurately by
avoiding the need to complete forms, respond to emails, or take up time in
meetings. Compared to conventional human-based approaches, Surveilr's machine
attestation technology offers a dependable and automated means of verifying
policy compliance, hence improving security and regulatory adherence.</p>
