Surveilr serves as an extendable file system inspector for performing surveillance of machine resources ( [learn more](/surveilr#surveilr) ). Any computing environment that supports SQLite can use the [Resource Surveillance State Database (RSSD)](/surveilr/reference/concepts/resource-surveillance#rssd) , which is created by the program. This enables a variety of tools, services, apps, and data warehouse integration to be made possible for the data gathered by Surveilr. Gathering machine-attested proof or evidence is made possible using Surveilr, which is beneficial for both security and compliance needs. Surveilr helps Individual contributors ( ICs ) focus on important task by automating the process of gathering compliance evidence as compared to manually feeling compliance forms which can be boring and counter-productive.
