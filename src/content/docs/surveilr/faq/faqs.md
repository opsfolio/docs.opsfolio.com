<h3>Why should I use Surveilr?</h3>
</summary>

Surveilr is the better option for gathering compliance proof through machine attestation, which is why you should use it. Code, test results, emails, issues/tickets, and wikis are examples of machine attestation artifacts that Surveilr's agent can use to conclusively demonstrate adherence to security, privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance policiesâ€”as opposed to human attestation, which depends on trust and manual processes. Through the use of this method, people can verify information more quickly and accurately by avoiding the need to complete forms, respond to emails, or take up time in meetings. Compared to conventional human-based approaches, Surveilr's machine attestation technology offers a dependable and automated means of verifying policy compliance, hence improving security and regulatory adherence.
